The default Courier font (or variant) is quite wide and you can only display up to 60 characters on a line.  If you replace it with a narrower font, you can get more characters on a line.  You may even use `FontForge <https://fontforge.github.io/>`_ and create narrow variants of some free font.  In my case I get up to 70 characters on a line."

msgid "In the stand-alone reader, ``info``, references are displayed just as they appear in the source.  Emacs, on the other-hand, will by default replace ``*note:`` with ``see`` and hide the ``target-id``.  For example:"

msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:268
msgid "The exact behavior of how Emacs displays references is dependent on the variable ``Info-hide-note-references``.  If set to the value of ``hide``, Emacs will hide both the ``*note:`` part and the ``target-id``.  This is generally the best way to view Sphinx-based documents since they often make frequent use of links and do not take this limitation into account.  However, changing this variable affects how all Info documents are displayed and most do take this behavior into account."
