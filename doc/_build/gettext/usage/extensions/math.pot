#: ../../usage/extensions/math.rst:28
msgid "This extension renders math via LaTeX and dvipng_ or dvisvgm_ into PNG or SVG images. This of course means that the computer where the docs are built must have both programs available."

#: ../../usage/extensions/math.rst:46
msgid "Since this setting is not portable from system to system, it is normally not useful to set it in ``conf.py``; rather, giving it on the :program:`sphinx-build` command line via the :option:`-D <sphinx-build -D>` option should be preferable, like this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/extensions/math.rst:53
msgid "This value should only contain the path to the latex executable, not further arguments; use :confval:`imgmath_latex_args` for that purpose."

msgid "Additional arguments to give to dvipng, as a list.  The default value is ``['-gamma', '1.5', '-D', '110', '-bg', 'Transparent']`` which makes the image a bit darker and larger then it is by default, and produces PNGs with a transparent background.

#: ../../usage/extensions/math.rst:97
msgid "``dvipng`` has the ability to determine the \"depth\" of the rendered text: for example, when typesetting a fraction inline, the baseline of surrounding text should not be flush with the bottom of the image, rather the image should extend a bit below the baseline.  This is what TeX calls \"depth\".  When this is enabled, the images put into the HTML document will get a ``vertical-align`` style that correctly aligns the baselines."
