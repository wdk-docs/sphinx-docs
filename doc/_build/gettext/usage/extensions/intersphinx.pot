msgid "Usage is simple: whenever Sphinx encounters a cross-reference that has no matching target in the current documentation set, it looks for targets in the documentation sets configured in :confval:`intersphinx_mapping`.  A reference like ``:py:class:`zipfile.ZipFile``` can then link to the Python documentation for the ZipFile class, without you having to specify where it is located exactly."

#: ../../usage/extensions/intersphinx.rst:21
msgid "When using the \"new\" format (see below), you can even force lookup in a foreign set by prefixing the link target appropriately.  A link like ``:ref:`comparison manual <python:comparisons>``` will then link to the label \"comparisons\" in the doc set \"python\", if it exists."

msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/extensions/intersphinx.rst:31
msgid "Projects using the Intersphinx extension can specify the location of such mapping files in the :confval:`intersphinx_mapping` config value.  The mapping will then be used to resolve otherwise missing references to objects into links to the other documentation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/extensions/intersphinx.rst:36
