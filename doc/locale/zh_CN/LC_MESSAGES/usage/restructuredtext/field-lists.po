"A field list near the top of a file is normally parsed by docutils as the"
" *docinfo* which is generally used to record the author, date of "
"publication and other metadata.  However, in Sphinx, a field list "
"preceding any other markup is moved from the *docinfo* to the Sphinx "
"environment as document metadata and is not displayed in the output; a "
"field list appearing after the document title will be part of the "
"*docinfo* as normal and will be displayed in the output."
msgstr "靠近文件顶部的字段列表通常由docutils解析为 *docinfo* ，它通常用于记录作者，发布日期和其他元数据。但是，在Sphinx中，任何其他标记之前的字段列表将作为文档元数据从 *docinfo* 移动到Sphinx环境，并且不会显示在输出中;文档标题后出现的字段列表将正常显示在 *docinfo* 中，并将显示在输出中。"
