"  A theme is a collection of HTML templates, stylesheet(s) and other "

"Using a :ref:`theme provided with Sphinx <builtin-themes>` is easy. Since"

"You can also set theme-specific options using the "

"contents is supported. The directory or zipfile must be put where Sphinx "
"can find it; for this there is the config value "
":confval:`html_theme_path`. This can be a list of directories, relative "
"to the directory containing :file:`conf.py`, that can contain theme "
